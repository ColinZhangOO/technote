# position

- static: Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
- absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element
- fixed: The element is positioned relative to the browser window
- relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position
- initial: Sets this property to its default value.
- inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.
